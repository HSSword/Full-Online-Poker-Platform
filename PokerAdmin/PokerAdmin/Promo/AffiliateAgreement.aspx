													This Standard Affiliate Agreement ("Agreement") contains the complete terms and 
													conditions that apply to an individual's or entity's participation in the
													<%=GetDomain()%>
													(the "Website") affiliate program ("Affiliate Program").<br>
													As used in this Agreement, "you" and "Affiliate" mean the individual or entity 
													which applied as the "BENEFICIARY" for payment purposes on our sign up form ("<a href="affiliatesignup.htm">Affiliate 
														Sign Up Form</a>") as submitted at the website, and "we", "us" and 
													"Website” means the Website(s) promoted hereunder and its owners, operators, 
													directors, agents, employees, consultants, suppliers, vendors and affiliated 
													companies.
													<br>
													<br>
													<b>I. GENERAL</b><br>
													<br>
													1.1 This is Version 6 of the Agreement, as released and posted as at the date 
													mentioned below. This Version 6, modifies, replaces and supersedes all prior 
													versions of this Agreement.
													<br>
													<br>
													1.2 By marketing for and referring new Players to Website through a Tracker, 
													YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET OUT IN THIS 
													AGREEMENT, and we will automatically become counter-party to this Agreement.
													<br>
													<br>
													1.3 IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO ACCEPT ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS 
													AGREEMENT, THEN DO NOT PROMOTE THE WEBSITE(S).
													<br>
													<br>
													<b>II. DEFINITIONS</b><br>
													<br>
													2.1 "Account" is the uniquely assigned account that is created for Player when 
													he/she opens an account at the Website.

													up as a participant in the Affiliate Program.

													<br>
													<br>
													2.4 "Affiliate Section" means the password-protected area of the Website that 
													is accessible to you to check stats, register Sub-Affiliates, update profile,

													Moreover, a Player's contribution to the "rakes" shall be determined as the 
													quotient obtained when dividing the actual amount of each rake to which the 
													Player had contributed divided by the total number of players at the table at 
													the start of the hand. So, if the rake in a hand with ten players at the table 
													is three dollars ($3.00), each player's contribution to the rake will be thirty 
													cents ($0.30).

													Up Bonus Codes and records you as the Affiliate. To encourage potential Players 
													to use Sign Up Bonus Codes, extra cash or other Sign Up Bonus Incentives may be 
													given to Players that enter Sign Up Bonus Codes. Further, Sign Up Bonus Codes 
													may automatically be entered/logged by the system with some CDs used for

													provide exclusively to you, through which we track and calculate Affiliate 
													Fees.
													<br>

													refer potential Players to the Website. When the Player opens his/her Account, 
													the system automatically logs the Tracking URL and records you as the 
													Affiliate.
													<br>

													<br>
													3.2 Marketing Activities and Responsibilities. You will, at your own cost and 
													expense, market to and refer potential Players to the Website. You will be 
													solely responsible for the content and manner of your marketing activities. All 
													marketing activities must be professional, proper and lawful under applicable 
													rules or laws. You represent and warrant that you will not place Banners or 
													Text Links to us on any website, or use any media or medium, which is libelous, 
													discriminatory, obscene, unlawful or otherwise unsuitable or which contains 
													sexually explicit, pornographic, obscene or graphically violent materials. You 
													will not actively target your marketing to any persons who are less than 18 
													years of age, regardless of the age of majority in the location you are 
													marketing. Under no circumstances will you send Spam that in anyway refers 
													users to us. Moreover all email marketing will be conducted in compliance with 
													Section 3.11 below.
													<br>
													<br>
													3.3 Approved Marketing Materials. You will only use the Banners and Text Links 
													and any other marketing materials that have been provided by us and/or 
													pre-approved by us (collectively the "Marketing Materials"). You will not 
													modify the Marketing Materials without our prior written consent. During the 
													term of this Agreement, we grant you a terminable, non-exclusive, 
													non-transferable right to use the Marketing Materials for the sole purpose of 
													marketing to and referring potential Players to the Website. Generally we will 
													provide you, without charge, the guidelines, graphical artwork and permitted

													Marketing Materials and any other promotional materials provided by us in a 
													manner that may potentially confuse a potential Player.
													<br>
													<br>
													3.4 Competitive Marketing. For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby clarified 
													that you shall not be entitled to market to potential Players (i) on any 
													Internet site on which we promote the Website; (ii) on any Internet search 
													engine on which we promote the Website; and (iii) in any other manner which 
													results in your competing with us in relation to the promotion of the Website. 
													In the event that you are in breach of the foregoing provisions, we reserve the 
													right to render the Tracking URLs assigned to you void and you shall have no 
													claims against us in respect of such action taken by us.
													<br>
													<br>
													3.5 Non Assignment. Trackers are for your sole use and are not to be assigned 
													to others without our written consent.
													<br>
													<br>
													3.6 Sub-Affiliates. In addition to marketing to and referring potential Players 
													to the Website, you may refer others to this Affiliate Program to also market 
													to and refer potential Players to the Website. In such event, we will pay you a 
													percentage of the amount paid to Sub-Affiliates for any Players they refer. To 
													receive credit for Sub-Affiliates, you must register them through the "Register 
													Sub-Affiliate" function within the Affiliate Section of the site. FOR CLARITY,

													<br>
													3.7 Commercial Use Only. This Marketing opportunity is for commercial use only, 
													and you may not sign up or make deposits to any Account, directly or

													under Section 3.4 ("Competitive Marketing") include the use of Our Marks in 
													connection with a website that includes links to a competitive gaming, gambling 
													or casino site without our prior written approval of such links and manner of 
													use. By way of example, but without limitation, you may not register or use

													you may not make use of Our Marks on a website that includes links to a

													calculating your Affiliate Fees. The form, content and frequency of the reports 
													may vary from time to time in our sole discretion. Generally, you will receive 
													a monthly report with your payment indicating the number of new Players signed 
													up that month, per Tracker, and/or the total amount of due to you. In addition, 
													daily reports will be available online for you to view new Players per Tracker.
													<br>
													<br>
													4.2 Affiliate Fees. Unless otherwise agreed, Affiliate Fees will be paid to you 
													on a calendar basis in accordance with the payment plan and rates you selected 
													(and confirmed to you by emailing upon sign-up and/or activation of additional 
													Trackers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may elect to not accept your 
													selected payment plan, in which case we will notify you within seven (7) days 
													of you signing-up or activating additional Trackers.
													<br>
													<br>
													4.3 Sub-Affiliate Fees. In addition to the above Affiliate Fee for Players you 
													refer, you will also receive, subject to the agreed upon payment plan and rate,

													4.4 Time of Payment. Affiliate Fees will be paid and sent out to you within 
													fifteen (15) days of the close of each calendar month, except that, if the 
													total amount due for all Trackers is less than $50, the balance will be carried 
													over and added to the next month's Affiliate Fees until the total amount is 
													more than $50. Further, if the amount due is negative in any particular month, 
													then that negative amount will carry over and be deducted against the following 
													month. In the event, the balance amount carried over does not total $50 within 
													a consecutive three (3) month period, then the amount due will be voided and 
													cancelled, and we may terminate this Agreement.
													<br>
													<br>
													4.5 Holdover for Fraud Traffic. In the event we suspect Fraud Traffic, then we 
													may delay payment of the Affiliate Fees to you for up to one hundred and eighty 
													(180) days while we investigate and verify the relevant transactions. In the 
													event that we determine the activity to constitute Fraud Traffic, or to 
													otherwise be in contravention of this Agreement, then in our sole discretion we 
													may recalculate and/or confiscate your Affiliate Fees accordingly. For the 
													avoidance of doubt, we are not obligated to pay on Players who in our sole 
													discretion are not verifiably who they say they are or are otherwise highly 
													likely to be involved with Fraud Traffic.
													<br>
													<br>
													4.6 Method of Payment. All payments will be due and payable in United States 
													Dollars only. Payment will be made by check, wire, ACH or any other method as

													right Trackers or for potential Players' failure to properly enter Sign Up 
													Bonus Codes. Further, you understand and agree that you will not receive credit 
													for Sub-Affiliates unless you expressly register them under you. We may at any 
													time change, in our sole discretion, our tracking system and reporting format.

													NOT accept payment for such amount and immediately send us written notice of 
													your dispute. Dispute notices must be received within thirty (30) days of the 
													end of each month for which payment is made, or your right to dispute such 
													report or payment will be deemed waived and you shall have no claims in such 
													regard. Further, deposit of payment check, acceptance of payment transfer or 
													acceptance of other payment by you will be deemed full and final settlement of 
													Affiliate Fees due for the month indicated.
													<br>
													<br>
													4.9 Negative Gross Revenue: In the event that the Gross Revenue quotient is a 
													negative amount during any given period(s), such negative amount shall be 
													carried forward and deducted from the Gross Revenue amount of the relevant 
													subsequent period of time. In the event that the Gross Revenue quotient is a
