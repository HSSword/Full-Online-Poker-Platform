PokerService might be running on one or more computers. It might be running in different modes 
in each machine depending of Registry settings:
 - ActionDispatcher (if set - work as Action Server, do not set - as Action Client);
 - ActionProcessor (if set - Process Action in Pooled Objects);
 - ClientAdapter (if set - Work as TCP/IP Server for Client Sessions);
 - GameAdapter (if set - Service create pool of different threads for Process actions 
   for different Processes - keep sessions for GameEngines);
 - Reminder (if set - create, change, reset and delete, and process actions that must be runned 
   in assigned time;
 - Tournament - (if set - process actions for tournaments).

PokerService have the following structure:

 - Service Core - include ServiceDataModule, CommonDataModule - the central part of the system 
   that include Logger unit, Settings unit, Error Constants and XML Constants units, 
   Object Pooling unit, Process actions routines. 
 - Internal system Communication modules - ActionDispatcher, ActionServer and ActionClient, 
   MSMQReader. 
 - External Client-Server communication module - ClientAdapter. 
 - Pooled Objects used in all Modes: API, Account, EMail, FileManager, SQLAdapter, User. 
 - Game actions support modules: GameAdapter, GameEngine, Tourmanent.

The communication between PokerServices running on different machines are implemented using TCP/IP 
protocol. One of the Services must be running as ActionServer mode, and all other - as ActionClient.
Communication between admin side and PokerService - using MSMQ.

Admin-site and PokerService.exe running in MSMQReader mode must be running in one machine.
Database (MS SQL Server) might be running on any machine.
