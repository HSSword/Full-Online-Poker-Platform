Before installation, please install MS SQL Server 2000, MSXML 4.0 of later and MDAC 2.7 or later.

To install the server, please do the following:
 
1.  In this description we will use folder "C:\Poker\" as the root folder for the system. 
2.  Create using MMC (Computer management tool) private non-transactional MSMQ message queues:
    A. Check first, if MS Windows's component "Message Queue Service" is installed. 
       Run "Start->Settings->Control Panel->Add or Remove  Programs". 
       Select "Add/Remove Windows Component". The box "Message Queue Service" must be checked. 
       If not - check it and click on the "Next" button. Then follow the instructions of the 
       Windows Components Wizard. 
       Run "Start->Settings->Control Panel->Administrative Tools->Computer Management". 
       Open "Services and Applications-> Message Queue". Select "Private Queue", right-click 
       on the ListView and select "New->Private Queue". Enter in the "pokerservice" name.
    B. It is neccessary to set all access permissions after private queue creating. 
       To do this, right-click on the private queue and select "Properties". 
       Switch on the "Security" bookmark and check full control for "All" user.
    C. Repeat those steps to create queue "pokeradmin".
3.  Create using MS SQL Server Enterprise Manager database named "Poker" or with another name:
    A. MS SQL Server must be installed on your computer.
    B. Run MS SQL Server Enterprise Manager on the server where
       "Start->Programs->MS SQL Server->Enterprize Manager" database will be
       located for creating database. Right-click on the "SQL Server Group -> local -> databases" 
       and select "New database". Enter in "Poker" name and click on the "OK" button. 
       As an alternative you can use "Run a Wizard"
    C. Restore the database from the file "C:\Poker\DB\DB.dat" (choose "All tasks"->"Restore database" 
       item from the created database ("Poker") context menu, then choose "From device" option and 
       choose database backup file location in "Choose device" area, and then restore it)
    D. Delete user "poker" (if such exists) from "Users" branch list of restored database "Poker" of "Database" branch.
       Then create new security login in "Security"->"Logins" branch 
       (user name "poker" and password "_poker_", you may use another name and passowrd, in this case you need to change
       appropriate data in all poker system config files and registry) and apply it for the "Poker" 
       database as "public" and "db owner" in "Database access" tab. 
       Please choose "SQL server authentication" and enter the password. 
       You may also use "Run a Wizard -> Database -> Create login wizard" from the 
       SQL Server Enterprise to create security login.

    PokerService will create appropriate keys and parameters in Registry.
    A. You can use "Start->Settings->Control Panel->Administration->Computer Management" for the 
       admission to the "Services" console. Select "Services".
    B. When PokerService starts, all required default keys will be automatically created within 
       the Registry. For the further setting real keys you will need to stop PokerService.
7.  Run Registry editor ("Regedit.exe") and change values.

    and change SQL connection string parameter - change "Initial Catalog" to database name and 
    "User ID" and "Password" to appropriate security login and password settings. 
    Set isActionDispatcher = 0 if PokerService on this computer will be running as balanced service; 
    Set isActionDispatcher = 1 if PokerService will be running as ActionDispatcher;
    Set isActionDispatcher = 2 if PokerService will be running as ActionDispatcher, ClientAdapter, GameAdapter and etc. - 
    this option is needed for systems with one computer with one PokerService running.
    Set correct values to another registry parameters if PokerService will be running in multi-service or 
    multi-computer environment. In this case need to fill table "ActionDispatchers" into database with appropriate 
    IP and Ports of all PokerServices running as ActionDispatchers.
    Change parameters "ClientAdapterPort" - port that PokerService will listen for client connections 
    (the same port number have to be set in client installation) and "ClientAdapterSSL" - 0 means that
