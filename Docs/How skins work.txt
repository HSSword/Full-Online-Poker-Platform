4. Phizical location of client files on client side. Client Side Application (CSA, PokerExcellence.exe) stored all its parameters in client registry in key HKCU/Software/<CSA name>/Settings as parameter AffiliateID. So, for PokerExcellence path will be HKCU/Software/PokerExcellence/Settings. Main of parameters are "Host","Port" and "SSL"- parameters of server connect and "AffiliateID" - unique identifier fro Affiliate and Skin where this user is assigned. All these four parameters are build-in into the installer that user download from the web-site. So, on connecting, CSA take these parameters from the registry and connect to the server using TCP/IP socket described in Host and Port registry values, and using or not SSL encryption, described in SSL registry value. After connect CSA send connect packet to the server with its version and AffiliateID. Server check need application of this user update or no, depended of exists updated client application for the skin user's CSA (server find skin by affiliateid) or user have fresh version. After succeded connect (or after auto-update), CSA send to server request of client files for its affiliateid, server find skin by affiliateid and send list of files to the client. CSA get list of client application files and compare it with local files. Updated files are downloaded to the client. All client files are stored into folder "Files" that is subfolder i\of the installation place (usually C:\Program FIles\<CSA name>). Files are downloaded into subfolder "Download" of that "Files" folder, and then, after comparison, moved to "Files" folder to use them.
5. Phizical location of client files of diferent skins on server side. There is folder named "PokerClientFiles" on server. Usually it located in "PokerAdmin" folder of the Poker root folder. This folder contains folders beginning with "Skin_" characters. Number after underline character is SkinID that you can see in admin-site on Skins list page. These folders contain all files of appropriate skin. So, all files you upload for the skin via admin-site, it store here. There are two special files - filelist.xml where list of files is stored is XML (this file appear after installation building) and flash.ocx - Flash player, that is included into the installation. There is folder "Installer" where files for installation are located, and after build of installation, installer file will be located there also.
